# My-project: Core Web Fundamentals Practice

This small project serves as a focused exercise in integrating the foundational trio of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective was to build a clean, functional page to ensure all three technologies are linked correctly and interact as intended.

## ⚙️ Project Stack

* **HTML5:** Used for the main page structure (including a `<button id="btn">`).
* **CSS3:** Applied for basic presentation (centering, font family, button padding).
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Implements a simple event handler on the button element.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Simply open the `Index.HTML` file in your preferred browser to view the live project.

### What it does:
The JavaScript (`app.js`) is set up to listen for a click event on the button and trigger a standard browser `alert("Welcome!")`.

## 💡 Next Steps / Future Work

My immediate plans for this project include:
1.  Replacing the temporary `alert()` with a more practical **DOM manipulation** (e.g., changing the text in the `<p>` tag).
2.  Expanding the HTML to include more detailed portfolio sections.
3.  Adding basic responsive design for mobile screens.
